# README.md

Things to know as we work together.

## Why

Clint Berry suggested having a README as human documentation for how to work with people.

## AJ ONeal

I have strong opinions.

My values:

- Strong opinions, loosely held
- If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything
- There should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do it
- Avoid Hasty Abstractions
- Flat is better than nested
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess
- Prefer native / standard library / built-in solutions unless you have a really good reason not to
- Saving a few keystrokes is never worth it
